# Basic Regular Expression and Web Scraping

This is my practice on regular expression & web scraping, including extract email address using RE and get the real time top story from a public website.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For this pratice, `re`, `bs.BeautifulSoup4` and `requests` packages are required.

### General guidance

In the Regular Expression part, I have done some practice on transforming time-format, strip irrelevant information, etc.

In the Web Scraping part, I have worked on getting the real time contents from a public news website and store the contents.
